The Food Order System is a full-stack web application developed using Python and Flask. It simulates a food order system (me and my friend's dream restaurant) with a many-to-many relationship database, allowing users to create accounts, order food, view orders, edit orders, and delete orders. Users can also manage their accounts, including creating and deleting them.

Python: The primary programming language used for the backend.<p>
Flask: A micro web framework for building web applications.<p>
SQLAlchemy: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python, used for working with the database.<p>
HTML and Jinja2 Templates: Used for creating the frontend.<p>

To run this project on your device you need to:
1. git clone
2. use flask seed to seed the database
3. use flask run to start the project
